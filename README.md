# Cherry Pick üçí

This is our project that won the first place at the 2022 nChain Hackathon. We had 24 hours to create something that would brighten the day of the elderly and/ or our partners. We also had to use Blockchain technology in some aspect of the project. We are Cherry pick, [Lan](https://github.com/LanVukusic) & [Jan](https://github.com/janvasiljevic), known by our ability to cherry pick the important commits 5 minutes before the deadline.

## Our idea   üåü

Sometimes elderly people struggle with technology - often mundane problems that can be quickly solved by more tech savvy younger population. A friend once told me a story, that his grandpa accidentally deleted the Chrome shortcut icon from his desktop. He was then called to restore back the Internet. While we, as programmers, might find stories like these amusing, not everyone has a relative who "knows computers".  
  
We thought of a platform, that would connect the two generations together. Those who need the help can create a special account, where they can post their problems in a simple and user friendly manner. Others, the so called helpers or assistants, can create a special technician account, where they see these offers and can provide the assistance. The platform is more good will oriented, and offers the ability of small payments in form of tips. The technicians are also rewarded with NFTs for certain milestones, like signing up, providing help to one person etc.

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

The project was made in 24hours and by 2 people. Some features had to be skipped and there are probably plenty of bugs.  

This Readme and associated documentation was made after the Hackathon, to better document the project and so we can reflect upon it down the road. All the code and everything else is the same as it was at the deadline. Check out the [commit](https://github.com/janvasiljevic/cherry-pick/commit/21ca8e58617d325af4b880bdfa2252cf99a0e8e8) if you wish to see the repository as it was presented.  

## Project setup üöß

To setup the project you will need the following software and tools:

- docker
- docker-compose
- make
- node
- yarn
- free port 5432, 4000, 3000 and 80
- a Metamask wallet with the following network
  - GoChain Testnet
  - `https://testnet-rpc.gochain.io/`
  - 31337
  - GO
  - `https://testnet-explorer.gochain.io/`
  - You will also need to import some tokens if you wish to see them:
    - SignUp token: `0x03a348BA542b59F9243892EAd692E497601cE7A5`
    - GoodSamaritan token: `0x83606Ca6a9Ed28979774E2e631c1648415799496`
    - FirstHelp token: `0xC1C8f2fb1C2f68953F576E93E126557856b7471E`

Also take note, that the wallet that pays the fees for the transactions needed for the NFTs reward to function, may run out of funds. Go to [https://faucet.gochain.io/](https://faucet.gochain.io/) and add some Go to `0x3fa9515050Dea4a1F3a81253417562320b9D71EA`.  

To spin up the project run the following 2 commands

```sh
make yarn
make dev-up
```

After Prisma migrations are applied, you should be able to visit the following two addresses:

- `http://localhost/` - the main platform
- `http://localhost/api/docs` - API documentation for NestJS backend  

![infra](docs/infra.png)

Quick infrastructure overview:

- NestJS API
  - main API which keeps track off Users and offers
  - interacts with the database (Prisma)
  - handles user security with JWT tokens encrypted in cookies
- GO NFT API
  - exposes a simple API that is called from NestJS to mint NFTs 
- PostgresSQL database
  - stores data needed for the app to operate
- React development server
  - hosts the website
  - main UI framework is ChakraUI
  - powered by Vite

## Some thoughts ü§î

Here are some things that we wish we had time to do:

- integrate [moneybutton](https://www.moneybutton.com/) into the platform to make payments to assistants possible
- make a functioning Frontend authentication system (currently the cookies/ tokens aren't refresh, so after 2 hours the app stops working)
- make the achievements/ NFT part more reusable and easier to develop with  
- use gRPC instead of HTTP for inter container communication
- build a production stack of the project
